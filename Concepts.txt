app hub gets all application files and allows the user to manually pick, add all, or search all -> add selected (add all found button)

password manager (all stored locally - safe) - allows to randomly generate passwords for apps and store them locally. Add functionality to add new password (if you want to use it for websites)

possible to make a radial menu with app running in background? > use app hub to create workstations > can be layouts of groups of apps (held positions)
- Work Station: Coding -> opens ChatGPT on left screen full screen, VS22 main screen full screen, etc
